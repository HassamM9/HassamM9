### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hassan Mansoor

#### Senior FullStack Mean Stack / React Developer 

Skilled FullStack Developer with several successfully funded startups & enterprises for the past 9 years.

I am a highly experienced full stack developer in ðŸŸ¢ Mean Stack + React Native from past 8 years. I have work with several funded startups and enterprises.

I enjoy working on challenging projects, and have experience in the following areas:
âœ… Angular 2 RC4
âœ… MEAN Stack
âœ… Bootstrap
âœ… Frontend, Backend,
âœ… Cordova, Sphinx
âœ… Payment integrations
âœ… MongoDB,
âœ… HTML/CSS3,, JSON, Git along with API's.

I would love to help you build a state of the art web application just as much as I would enjoy working on existing or legacy projects (developing new features, updating technologies, or bringing best practices and testing in to unstable or poorly structured code).

âœ… For startups: Speed, Flexibility, and Ideas.

âœ… For Intermediaries and Marketing Agencies: Transparency, Integration, and Reliability.

âœ… Established Businesses outsourcing their IT Department: Business Values, Risk-Sharing, and Integration into their processes.

Do you have an amazing idea that you want to bring to life? Or do you have a stable business that you want a credible developer/team to handle? We are here for you!
